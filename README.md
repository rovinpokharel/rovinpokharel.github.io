A clean and nice portfolio website made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Contents on the page are Home, About, Skills, Work and Contact. At first, your name, links to social networks and a great image. Then the About section displays more information about you. Then the list of Skills it offers. It also has a section where it shows some recent work. And at the bottom it has a form, and at the end with a footer.
